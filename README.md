# Automation-Game
Salford University Year 2 - Design Patterns. 

The nature of this assignment was to create a 2D game using JavaFX, adding relevant design patterns throughout development.

I made a 2D automation game, inspired by games such as Factorio and Satisfactory. Everything is my own work and all assets use are either made by myself or have been purchased.
